/**
 * source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/Insertion-sort/
 * Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands.
 * <p>
 * Algorithm
 * <p>
 * 1- insertionSort(arr, n)
 * <p>
 * 2- Loop from i = 1 to n-1.
 * <p>
 * 3- Pick element arr[i] and insert it into sorted sequence arr[0â€¦i-1]
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * 12, 11, 13, 5, 6
 * <p>
 * Let us loop for i = 1 (second element of the array) to 4 (last element of the array)
 * <p>
 * i = 1. Since 11 is smaller than 12, move 12 and insert 11 before 12
 * 11, 12, 13, 5, 6
 * <p>
 * i = 2. 13 will remain at its position as all elements in A[0..I-1] are smaller than 13
 * 11, 12, 13, 5, 6
 * <p>
 * i = 3. 5 will move to the beginning and all other elements from 11 to 13 will move one position ahead of their current position.
 * 5, 11, 12, 13, 6
 * <p>
 * i = 4. 6 will move to position after 5, and elements from 11 to 13 will move one position ahead of their current position.
 * 5, 6, 11, 12, 13
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Time Complexity: O(n2) as there are two nested loops.
